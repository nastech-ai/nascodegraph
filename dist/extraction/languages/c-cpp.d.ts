 * Base { … }` is indexed as a node named `Base`, but a derived class
 * `class D : public Base<int>` records its base as the full `Base<int>` (and
 * `class Q : public ns::Tpl<int>` as `ns::Tpl<int>`) — neither name-matches
 * `Base` / `ns::Tpl`, so the `extends` edge never resolves and the derived class
 * looks like it inherits from nothing (#1043).
 *
 * Removes every balanced `<…>` group regardless of nesting or position, so
 * `Base<int>` → `Base`, `ns::Tpl<Foo<int>>` → `ns::Tpl`, and the rare
 * `Outer<int>::Inner` → `Outer::Inner`. The remaining qualified head is exactly
 * what the non-templated base case already produces, so resolution treats them
 * identically. A name with no template args passes through unchanged.
